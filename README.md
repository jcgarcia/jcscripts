## Overview

>This repository includes scripts that automate tasks such as AWS profile
management, device handling, and more. The scripts are organized into a
compact library file (`scripts.ar`) to make distribution easy and
efficient. Each script is documented and designed for ease of use,
customization, and flexibility.

---
## Prerequisites
> Before using this repository, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

1. **Linux Operating System**

    Compatible with most Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch).

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S aws-cli
    ```
2. Confirm the installation:
    ```bash
    aws --version
    ```
#### For Alpine Linux
1. Use the apk package manager:

    ```bash
    sudo apk add aws-cli
    ```
2. Ensure AWS CLI is installed:

    ```bash

## Getting Started

### Steps to Set Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcgarcia/jcscripts.git
mv jcscripts ~/.scripts && cd ~/.scripts
```
2.  Run the setup script:

```bash
./installscripts
```
3.  The setup script will:

    -   Verify that all required components are present, including
        README.md, README.pdf, .jcscripts, installscripts, and
        lib/scripts.ar.

    -   Extract scripts from the scripts.ar library into the directory
        specified in .jcscripts (default: ~/.scripts).

    -   Make valid shell scripts executable.

    -   Add the .scripts directory to your system's PATH for easy
        access.

4.  After installation, you can call any script directly by its name
    from any location:

```bash
script_name
```

## One-Liner Installation

To quickly install the JC Scripts Collection, run the following command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcgarcia/jcscripts/main/installscripts)
```

> **Note**: Ensure you have internet access and `curl` installed on your system.

This command will:

1. Download and execute the `installscripts` script directly.
2. Set up the environment for the JC Scripts Collection.

After installation, you can use the scripts directly from any location.

## Configurations

The `.jcscripts` file contains configuration options for the scripts repository. Below are the configurable values:

- **EDITOR**: Specifies the text editor for editing scripts (default: `vi`).
- **SCRIPTS_DIR**: Defines the directory where the scripts will be stored (default: `~/.scripts`).
- **SSH_KEY**: Path to the SSH key for accessing GitHub (default: `~/.ssh/personalkey.pem` you must generate your own key and change that in the config file).

### Generating an SSH Key

To generate your own SSH key:

1. Run the provided script, and follow the prompts to create the key.
  
```bash
   ./generate_ssh_key
```


2. Follow the prompts to create the key.


- Copy the contents of the public key file (~/.ssh/personalkey.pem.pub):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/personalkey.pem.pub
```
- Log in to GitHub and navigate to Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key.
[Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?form=MG0AV3)


- Paste the contents into the Key field, give it a meaningful title, and save.


Example .jcscripts file:

```bash

# Configuration for scripts
EDITOR="vi"
SCRIPTS_DIR="~/.scripts"
```

## Fixing PATH Export Issue on Alpine Linux

If the `PATH` export is not working on Alpine Linux, follow these steps to ensure the `.scripts` directory is added to your `PATH`:

1. Open the shell configuration file for editing. Depending on your shell, this could be:
   - For `bash`:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - For `ash` (default shell on Alpine):
     ```bash
     nano ~/.profile
     ```

2. Add the following line to export the `.scripts` directory to your `PATH`:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.scripts:$PATH"
   ```

3. Save the file and reload the shell configuration:
   - For `bash`:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - For `ash`:
     ```bash
     source ~/.profile
     ```

4. Verify that the `.scripts` directory has been added to your `PATH`:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

5. Test the setup by running any script from the `.scripts` directory:
   ```bash
   script_name
   ```

If the issue persists, ensure that the `.scripts` directory exists and contains the scripts:
```bash
ls -l ~/.scripts
```
